# CommonInterviewQuestions
This repository contains my solutions to problems often asked about during job interviews etc.
Code is mostly written in Java. Problems are taken from/inspired by content found allover the Net. 
A lot of similar questions are solved in another repository called CodeWars
(problems and code ideas taken from CodeWars.com website).
